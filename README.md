# ORB1T V19.0 ALPHA
**Elevator pitch**

OBJEX V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. All the sensors and basic parts, no soldering needed.

**What is it?**

ORB1T V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. This development board includes all sensors and base parts, no soldering needed. 
I decided to make ORB1T V19.0 to improve the development of my IoT projects. Usually, I have to use multiple modules creating a tangle of cables.

**Why I made this?**

I made ORB1T v19 for my IoT projects, because the Arduino uno and other similar platforms are not ready for IoT applications.
So in December 2019 I Designed ORB1T V19 in only 2 weeks. Orbit v19 is the perfect solution for your iot project, because you have microcontroller/wifi connection and sensors in a single board.

**You don't need anything**

- You don't need external shields (Bme280, sensors ecc..)
- You can control any element with modular bus (power and data)

*For example: you can remove an sensor from the power/data bus*
